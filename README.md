# Supervised Machine Learning Using scikit-learn
This repo contains a jupyter notebook that demonstrates two machine learning models using the machine learning library scikit-learn. The models demonstrated are the Logistical Regression model and the Random Forest Classifier model.

In this repo you will find:
|Notebook|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|[Credit Risk Evaluation Notebook](credit_risk_eval.ipynb)| A jupyter notebook containing forethoughts on machine learning models, my prediction of which one may perform better, the fitting and training of two models on a dataset, my thoughts on each, and my overal concluding thoughts|

|Data|Description|
|----|-----------|
|[Lending Data](Resources/lending_data.csv)| A csv file containing 8 columns, `loan_size`, `interest_rate`, `borrower_income`, `debt_to_income`, `number_of_accounts`,`derogatory_marks`, `total_debt`, and `loan_status`. All were used as parameters for the model fitting.|

## Why?

In order to better understand superviced machine learning modeling and the differences or strengths of different models is the reason for this project. Ultimately, I believe my key take away from this notebook was that the dataset is ultimately what matters. For example, in this case I believe the dataset is well suited to either model. I believe that is indicitive of a good dataset that contains values that have high relatability together to the outcome. With that in mind, here are my abridged thoughts on either model. I go into more discussion in the [Credit Risk Evaluation Notebook](credit_risk_eval.ipynb).

|Model|Thoughts|
|-----|--------|
|[Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)| A high regarded model that shines with linear data. I do not believe that the dataset used provides any challenges for the Logistic Regression model. Performed fastest.|
|[Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)| A decision tree predictor. Performed just as well as the Logistic Regression model on this dataset. I do not believe that the dataset used provides any challenges for the model, nor does it provide anything that it might excel at versus the other model. Performed much slower.|

Ultimately, between the two it could be a contest of speed, which the Logistic Regression model wins at, at least for me ancedotely, though the time taken by either was neglible. 

I believe I at least progressed my understanding of what is important to making a choice on what model to use thanks to this project.
