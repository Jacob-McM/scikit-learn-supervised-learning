    "I believe that the Random Forest Classifier will outperform the Logistic Regression model *if* I model the data to properly suit either model's strengths. To expand, I believe that the Logistic Regression model is more likely to perform better if I do not create well thought out models. From my reading and understanding, Logistic Regression models suffer from overfitting which could lead to reliability risk in the predictive ability of the model. Logistic Regression models also suffer from limited scope in their dimensional analysis, something that a Random Forest Classifier does not have issues with. With my limited understanding of credit risk evaluation, I would think that the kind of analysis to most accurately provide an answer of whether or not someone is lended money would be multidimensional. I also believe that you are not always going to be able to have access to the information that would make a Random Forest Classifier outperform the Logistic Regression Model. \n",

My secondary reasoning is that I believe with my ability, I am more likely to have success using the Logistic Regression Model.\n"

    "Both models performed well, performing just as well as each other. The Logistic Regression model returned an accuracy for me that generally falls around `0.991848` and so on. The Random Forest Classifier model returned an accuracy for me that generally falls around `0.991487` and so on. The accuracy difference between these is `0.00036`. At this point, I still consider myself a layman-in-learning about machine learning. At this point, justifying a difference between either result feels like splitting hairs. My prediction is numerically correct in that the Logistic Regression model provided a higher score. To me, my prediction feels like a wash, and either model can be used on this data to provide insight into what loan status the parameters provided deserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did they perform nearly the same? Ignoring any potential user error, the discussion could be about the dataset. The dataset, from my understanding/interpretation is linearly separable, and is not complicated by the need for multidimensional analysis, nullifying an advantage Random Forest might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, I would say based on this, this dataset can be interpreted and trained on either model to produce a well trained result, as either model must be well suited to the parameters of the dataset. To me, that means that the markers that determine a 0 or 1 for a given loan status are consistent and well based on the parameters in this dataset. If I had to say, the dataset does have a lot of information that lends itself to establishing a good basis for predictability, even just for a human. Loan size, Debt:Income, and derogatory marks seem like strong rules of thumb for lending practices. If my understanding is correct, these are also relative parameters that are factors in one's credit score, which from my knowledge, a credit score can be a deciding factor in a borrower receiving consideration for a loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, my conclusion would be that both models are suitable for this dataset, and both perform well."
